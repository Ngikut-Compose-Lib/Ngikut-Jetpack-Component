`Ngikut Jetpack-Component` is a library that including components that might be used on most Android application. Now `Ngikut` is only available for Jetpack Compose, but gate not closed if I also make it into other environment.

# Preparation
Before you able to accessing `Ngikut`, you have to know that we are using `Jitpack` to make this library public. So you have to include Jitpack inside your project first.

### 1. Setup for Jitpack
-   For old version of gradle (before arctic fox update)
    
    Add this in your root  `build.gradle`  file (project scope) :
    
    ```gradle
    allprojects {
	    repositories {
		    ..
		    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	    }
    }
    ```

-   For gradle version 7 or latest

    Add this in your root `setting.gradle` file :
    
    ```gradle
    dependencyResolutionManagement {
        repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
        repositories {
            ..
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
### 2. Setup Ngikut to Your Dependency

-   After succesfully including Jitpack, right now you able to implement `Cisu` in your project.

    Add this to your `build.gradle` (app scope) :
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        ..
        implementation 'com.github.fahmirumagutawan:Cisu-Jetpack-Component:$cisu_version'
    }
    ```
